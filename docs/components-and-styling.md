# 🧱 Components And Styling

## Components Best Practices

#### Colocate things as close as possible to where it's being used

Keep components, functions, styles, state, etc. as close as possible to the component where it's being used. This will not only make your codebase more readable and easier to understand but it will also improve your application performance since it will reduce redundant re-renders on state updates.

#### Avoid large components with nested rendering functions

Do not add multiple rendering functions inside your application, this gets out of control pretty quickly. What you should do instead is if there is a piece of UI that can be considered as a unit, is to extract it in a separate component.

```javascript
// this is very difficult to maintain as soon as the component starts growing
function Component() {
  function renderItems() {
    return <ul>...</ul>;
  }
  return <div>{renderItems()}</div>;
}

// extract it in a separate component
function Items() {
  return <ul>...</ul>;
}

function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Items />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Stay consistent

Keep your code style consistent. e.g If you name your components by using pascal case, do it everywhere. More on this can be found [here](./style-guide.md)

#### Limit the number of props a component is accepting as input

If your component is accepting too many props you might consider splitting it into multiple components or use the composition technique via children or slots.

## Component libraries

This project is currently using Chakra UI as its component library.

## Global Styles

The main theme is adjusted in our themes.ts file. This refers to global colors, background colors, font colors, etc.
